## About this fork
This is a full unchanged clone of the repository at https://github.com/originell/sorl-watermark 
 
I can't install the original package in docker container from Github, only from Pypi. Well, I could do it, but I would 
have to install git into my container, but I want to keep it as small as possible. The original project 
at https://pypi.org/project/sorl-watermark/ is outdated, so I forked and published the latest version on Pypi under 
the new name **sorl-wmark**, and you can install it with

    $ pip install sorl-wmark

# sorl-watermark

sorl-watermark adds support for watermarking to sorl-thumbnail.

Supports:

* Django 1.3+ (tested with Django 1.10.4 up to 2.1)
* Sorl-Thumbnail 11+ (tested with 12.4a1 to 12.5.0)
* Pillow 3+ (tested with 3, 4.2 and 5)
* Python 2.7 to 3.7

Of course everything is configurable, from the watermark image to position and
opacity.

If you are looking for a sorl engine to dynamically create text watermarks,
you might want to have a look at [zeus/watermark](https://bitbucket.org/zeus/watermarker/overview).

## Setup

Install via pip

    $ pip install sorl-wmark

Change sorl's thumbnail engine to one from sorl-watermark. PIL and imagemagick are
supported.

PIL:

```python
# PIL is the most well tested backend.
THUMBNAIL_ENGINE = 'sorl_watermarker.engines.pil_engine.Engine'
```

Pgmagick:

```python
# PIL is the most well tested backend.
THUMBNAIL_ENGINE = 'sorl_watermarker.engines.pgmagick_engine.Engine'
```

Next up, you tell it which image should be used as a watermark. Note that this file
has to live somewhere inside `STATIC_ROOT`.

```python
THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK = 'my_watermark.png'
```

That's it for a simple setup. The engine will only apply the watermark if the
thumbnail size is big enough.

See _Advanced Usage_ for ways to dynamically change the watermark itself, it's size
or ways to selectively apply watermarks.

## Advanced Usage

sorl-watermark adds additional options to the `{% thumbnail %}` templatetag.

The following new options are available:

* `watermark=imagefile`
  This options takes an ImageFile and uses this one instead of the default
  watermark file, set via `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK`
* `watermark_size="x200"`
  Changes the watermark's size. Takes the same options as the
  `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_SIZE` option.
* `watermark_pos="north east"`
  Specifies where the watermark shall be put. Accepts the same options as the
  `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_POSITION` setting.
* `watermark_alpha=0.9`
  Sets the watermark's opacity. Has to be a value between 0 and 1.

## Settings Reference

The following settings are available

* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK`
  Sets the image to be used as a watermark. The file must live within `STATIC_ROOT`.

* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_ALWAYS`
  Stamp a watermark on every image.
  Default is `True`.

* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_SIZE`
  Change the size of the watermark. This can either be a geometry string, as is usual
  with sorl-thumbnail ("x200", "200x200"), or a percentage. If given a percentage,
  the watermark will always be the given percentage of the thumbnail size.

* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_OPACITY`
  An integer from 0 to 1, specifying the opacity of the watermark.
  Default is `0` (opaque).

* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_POSITION`
  Specifies the position of the watermark. You can specify the position with a pair
  of padding values (in pixels) Ex. "20 20" will place watermark near the left-top
  corner, "-20 -20" - near the right-bottom corner.
  Either you can specify the position as:

    * "north"
    * "south"
    * "west"
    * "east"
    * "north east"
    * "south east"
    * "north west"
    * "south west"
    * "center"

  Default: `"south east"` (right-bottom corner)

  If you want to tile your image completely with a watermark, you should set:

    ```python
    THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_POSITION = 'tile'
    ```
